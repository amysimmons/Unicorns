Their skills, however, are in demand. In the words of those at the forefront of digital journalism, here's why...</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;The oversimplified explanation is that most journalism students can't code or do math, while most computer science students don't know storytelling. Hybrids on either side are rare, and we're scooping them up as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;There is something about not just being able to think and act like a programmer but also to be able to think and act like a journalist, which is quite demanding... It's an unusual skill set. Newsrooms are crying out for these skills.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;When covering a story, you'll think in terms of data and interactivity from the very start and see how they can become part of the narrative. You'll see data everywhere - from the kind that floats in the air thanks to augmented reality, to the more mundane version contained in endless streams of status updates. Rather than being intimidated by the enormous amount of data, you'll see opportunities - new ways to bring news and information to the community.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;If you want to work on a subject like school performance, crime, government spending, or any of the countless others that involve complex data, having a technical toolset is important. A little bit of code can give you a big leg up in terms of finding, cleaning, and exploring data. If you think you can compartmentalize the "data" work and give it to someone else, or that you're fine only reporting stories you can find browsing Excel, someone else is going to eat your lunch.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;Being able to program (or otherwise obtain and analyse datasets) essentially opens up an entirely new avenue of obtaining sources and stories that was previously closed to the newsroom. It allows you to assemble and query information as a source to see trends, anomalies and facts. This might be an important political story, like writing a program that can spot undisclosed political donations by cross-referencing databases, or it might be in culture, such as examining how our movie and music tastes have shifted over time. The importance of this will only increase as more of our world and its functions, be they social, commercial, political or cultural, become more reliant on and integrated with technology.&rdquo;</p>

Pretty much everybody who comes to work for us has a basic understanding  of Microsoft Excel, knows how to do some basic coding.&rdquo;</p>

Putting technology to use for journalism needs not two distinct cultures but a new and unified one. Anything else would be flagrant and frivolous.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="quote">&ldquo;Newsrooms need a template for unicorns, particularly young ones, before they find themselves pigeonholed. Maybe it means creating new positions that take advantage of their hybrid skills. Maybe it means rotating them between writing and technology jobs. Or maybe it means pairing them with managers, like the ones I was lucky enough to have, who can resist exploiting their scarce tech skills in order to develop them in other ways. Either way, it starts with believing they exist.&rdquo;</p>
